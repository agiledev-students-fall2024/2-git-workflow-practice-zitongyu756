## Understanding AI with Real-Time Data

Artificial intelligence algorithms are designed to make decisions, often using real-time data. Unlike passive machines capable only of mechanical or predetermined responses, AI systems use sensors, digital data, or remote inputs to combine information from a variety of different sources, analyze the material instantly, and act on the insights derived from those data. With massive improvements in storage systems, processing speeds, and analytic techniques, they are capable of tremendous sophistication in analysis and decision-making.

### Machine Learning and Data Analytics

AI is generally undertaken in conjunction with machine learning and data analytics. Machine learning takes data and looks for underlying trends. If it spots something that is relevant for a practical problem, software designers can take that knowledge and use it to analyze specific issues. All that is required are data that are sufficiently robust for algorithms to discern useful patterns. Data can come in the form of digital information, satellite imagery, visual information, text, or unstructured data.

### Peer's Comment
- **Ashley Liu**: Machine learning is a popular topic nowadays and forms the core of many companies and startups. I would love to learn more.
